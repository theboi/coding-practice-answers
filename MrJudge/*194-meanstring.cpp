/**
 * 194. meanstring
 * Syntax
 * 
 * Rar the Cat wants to play with a piece of string, but his string is special. As with the tradition of the Nation of Insanity (NOI), all strings are made of numbers! (We did say insanity)
 * Not knowing the average of the string of numbers you're playing with isn't fun. But Rar's intense focus on murdering the string has made him unable to do any calculations.
 * Help Rar find the average of all the numbers! (There may be decimals, just ignore them. int will do that for you automatically)
 * 
 * Input:
 * The first line of input contains an integer, N, that denotes the length of the string of numbers.
 * This is followed by N integers, the ith integer being the ith number on Rar's string.
 * Output:
 * A single number, the average of the number on the string
 * Limits: 0 ≤ N ≤ 1000
 * The sum of all numbers will fit into a 32-bit signed integer.
 * 
 * Sample Input 1:
 * 5
 * 1 2 3 4 5
 * Sample Output 1:
 * 3
 * 
 * Sample Input 2:
 * 20
 * 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20
 * Sample Output 2:
 * 10
