/**
 * 294. breakfast
 * Syntax
 * 
 * Bradley, being an awesome nutritionist, is having peanuts for breakfast 
 * today. In fact, he is planning to investigate the effect of eating peanuts 
 * for breakfast on his health. However, you do not have to care about that 
 * today, because he, being an even more awesome programmer, has come out with
 * a voice-activated robot that scans his health upon hearing him say 
 * "PARAMECIUM".
 * 
 * Write a program that can help Bradley activate the robot by 
 * outputting "PARAMECIUM".
 * 
 * The output should contain a single line with the word "PARAMECIUM".
 * The output should be terminated with a newline.
 * 
 * Sample Output 1:
 * PARAMECIUM
