/**
 * 65. 3n+1
 * Syntax
 * 
 * The 3n+1 sequence is generated as follows. Starting from a number n, we get
 * the next number in the sequence by doing this:
 * - If n is even, the next number is n/2.
 * - If n is odd, the next number is 3n+1.
 * 
 * We continue this way until we reach 1.
 * 
 * Your task is: given n â‰¤ 10000, generate the sequence.
 * 
 * Sample Input 1:
 * 5
 * Sample Output 1:
 * 5 16 8 4 2 1
 * 
 * Sample Input 2:
 * 7
 * Sample Output 2:
 * 7 22 11 34 17 52 26 13 40 20 10 5 16 8 4 2 1
